<h3> Running BEE-atified VPIC using Docker in AWS </h3>

Follow the DSS Viz Wiki instructions on configuring and starting a cluster https://darwin.lanl.gov/projects/vizproject/wiki/AWS-setup-notes and https://darwin.lanl.gov/projects/vizproject/wiki/Starcluster-notes.

Once a Starcluster Enviroment is configured (see below), running VPIC in AWS consists of logging into a StarCluster from your local machine. 
````
starcluster start -x <clustername>
starcluster sshmaster <clustername>
````
Then pulling the VPIC code from docker and configuring your parallel environment.
````
cd /home/vpic
git clone https://github.com/Tomyao/vpicdocker.git
cd vpicdocker
mkdir -p ../vpicrun
chmod 777 -R ../vpicrun
````
Once logged into the StarCluster, you will need to edit _hostfile_ and _machinefile_ to reflect the topology of the cluster that you 
have launched.  _hostfile_ is in OpenMPI format and should have 1 slot per node and is used to launch docker on each node.
_machinefile_ should be in MPICH format and have one slot per core or virtual processor in AWS.

Examples for configuring parallelism:
````
Hostfile for a four node StarCluster:
  master slots=1
  node001 slots=1
  node002 slots=1
  node003 slots=1
  
Machinefile of 4 node cluster of m3.xlarge instances with 4 vCPUS:
  master:4
  node001:4
  node002:4
  node003:4
````
Start up the docker initialization with:
````
mpirun -hostfile hostfile --mca btl_tcp_if_include eth0 ./mpibuild_vpic.sh --verbose
````

<h3> Interactive Launch </h3>
   
  * Test your installation with an interactive launch.  The following starts sshd on all the slave docker containers in the background, then launches a root bash shell on the master node docker container, and then runs the simulation.
````
mpirun -hostfile hostfile --mca btl_tcp_if_include eth0 ./mpirun_sshd.sh --verbose
docker run -it --net=host -v /home/vpic/vpicrun:/mnt/vpicrun vpic /bin/bash
./launch.sh
````
Running docker with the _-it_ option gives you an interactive shell inside the container that you can use to edit and run codes.

  * Monitor the output -- from the virtual machine (not inside the container).  You will need another shell.
  
````
tail -f /home/vpic/vpicrun/.....
````

  * Terminate the docker containers running the cluster.  This is run from the StarCluster shell, not inside the container.
````
mpirun -hostfile hostfile --mca btl_tcp_if_include eth0 ./mpistopcluster.sh --verbose
````
